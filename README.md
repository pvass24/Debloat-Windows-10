# Debloat-Windows-10
This Repo contains a Powershell script to remove all of the unnecessary bloatware installed on windows 10.

Please run this Script as ADMIN


By default executing Poweshell Scripts are Restricted. To allow the execution of PowerShell Scripts we need to set this ExecutionPolicy either as Bypass or Unrestricted. 

Use this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

This command will allow scripts to run in this current Powershell session. 

Run the program again and you should have no issues.






*Disclaimer* I am not the creator of this script. I do not remember where I got it. I did make a few changes to this script however I do not want to take credit for someone else's hard work.
